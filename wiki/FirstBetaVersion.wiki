= Introduction =

tadd_labels is a plugin for ruTorrent that makes it easier to add labels to new torrent files.

*jQuery* wraps label textbox with div and removes the textbox. It then appends a dropdown, textbox, and button to the div. jQuery then appends an OPTION for each of the labels present in ruTorrent. jQuery is a very nice man.
